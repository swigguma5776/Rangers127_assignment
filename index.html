        I don't care how old you are, if you are grabbing snacks for a road trip and it doesn't look 
        like an unsupervised 8 year old was given $50 at a gas station, then we can't be friends.

        I don't think I have a favorite joke, and that's ironic as someone who dabbles in improv 
        and standup.  More than likely I just don't like the "favorite" type of questions haha. 
        Most of my best jokes I write are sexual in nature, and I'd rather play it safe than to potentially
        violate the student contract, so Google will have to suffice:
        <br>
        <br>
        Thereâ€™s a fine line between a numerator and a denominator.
        <br>
        <br>
        Only a fraction of people will get this joke

    <p> Where does a dad keep his jokes? ...His Dadabase.

        I don't really know any jokes but if something isn't funny to me sometimes I say
        "wow, that was so funny I forgot to laugh."
