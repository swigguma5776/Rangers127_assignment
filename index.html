    <h1>Hello Rangers 127 Cohort!</h1>
    <p>
        We are very excited to kick off the next 10 weeks with y'all. But it's very
        important, before we begin, for us to know how funny y'all are. 
    </p>
    <p> 
        Please add below in a p tag your favorite joke. Once complete, push up to Github & send a pull
        request to your cool instructor, Alex. Thanks!

        I don't care how old you are, if you are grabbing snacks for a road trip and it doesn't look 
        like an unsupervised 8 year old was given $50 at a gas station, then we can't be friends.

        I don't really know any jokes but if something isn't funny to me sometimes I say
        "wow, that was so funny I forgot to laugh."
